# Contributing

## Principles
- Schema-first, deterministic, auditable.
- Backwards-compatible changes when possible.
- Clear commit messages and PR titles.

## Pull Requests
- One topic per PR.
- Add tests when changing validation/build behavior.
- Keep exports reproducible and committed when required.

## Review
CODEOWNERS approval is required for changes that affect:
- schemas (`schema/`)
- exports (`exports/`)
- validation/build tools (`tools/`)
