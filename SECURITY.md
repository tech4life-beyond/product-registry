# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue or a supply-chain risk:
- Do not open a public issue with exploit details.
- Contact the Tech4Life & Beyond Owners/Architects via the organization’s security reporting channel.

## Supported Versions
The `main` branch is the supported version for security fixes unless a tagged release is explicitly maintained.

## Supply-Chain Controls
- GitHub Actions must be pinned by commit SHA.
- CI dependencies must be version-pinned where practical.
