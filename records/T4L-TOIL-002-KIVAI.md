## 1. Ownership & Authorship

Original Inventor: Ariel Martin  
Entity: Tech4Life & Beyond LLC (Florida, USA)

This product is created, published, and governed under the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0.

All rights are licensed, not sold.

## 2. Problem Statement

Modern devices and AI systems are fragmented.

Product teams, creators, and partners need a **unified, auditable interoperability layer** to translate high-level intents (human or AI) into **authorized actions** across many device types, protocols, and environments.

Without a shared routing and authorization layer, device control becomes:

- inconsistent
- insecure
- hard to scale
- difficult to audit

---

## 3. Solution Overview

Kivai is an **interoperability gateway and intent routing layer** between AI systems (or user interfaces) and physical/digital devices.

Kivai is:

- **not** a chatbot or assistant
- **not** a UI product
- **not** a product registry

Kivai is:

- schema-first and deterministic
- auditable and traceable
- gateway-orchestrated
- device-agnostic
- designed to route canonical **Intent JSON** into authorized execution via adapters

High-level flow:

AI / UI / Button → Intent JSON → Kivai (validate + auth + route) → Adapter → Device → ACK + audit log

---

## 4. Core Functional Elements

- Canonical Intent JSON schema (contract-first)
- Schema validation and normalization
- Authorization and policy enforcement
- Routing to device adapters (protocol/device agnostic)
- Deterministic execution acknowledgements (execution_id)
- Audit logging and traceability

---

## 5. Intended Beneficiaries

Primary users:

- Tech4Life product teams and creators building connected products
- Integration partners (manufacturers / device ecosystems)
- Developers building adapters and gateways
- Operators deploying Kivai as a local gateway (e.g., Raspberry Pi / router)

Primary benefit: a single, structured interoperability layer that makes device control consistent, secure, and scalable.

---

## 6. Ethical Declaration

Kivai:

- Does not intentionally harm humans, animals, or ecosystems
- Enforces authorization and traceability as safety mechanisms
- Avoids manipulative or extractive mechanisms
- Aligns with Tech4Life & Beyond ethical framework

Ethics are treated as a structural design constraint.
