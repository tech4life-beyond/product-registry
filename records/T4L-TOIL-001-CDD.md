## 2. Problem Statement

HVAC condensate drain line blockages are a frequent and costly failure point that can result in:

- Water overflow and property damage
- Mold growth and associated health risks
- Equipment shutdowns and service interruptions

Existing solutions typically respond after overflow has already occurred and do not enable proactive inspection or structured preventative maintenance.

The Clean Drain Device is a compact, inline HVAC condensate drain adapter designed to:

- Enable early clog detection  
- Restrict backflow  
- Allow direct flushing and maintenance  
- Provide visual inspection of internal flow

The device integrates mechanical flow control, optional sensor-trigger activation, and a maintenance access port into a unified structural adapter.
