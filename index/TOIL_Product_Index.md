## 1. Purpose

The TOIL Product Index is the **single authoritative registry** of all products, systems, and innovations created, published, or incubated under Tech4Life & Beyond LLC.

This index exists to:
- Establish clear authorship and origin
- Provide timestamped traceability (prior art)
- Prevent internal and external conflicts
- Enable licensing, royalty tracking, and audits
- Serve as the backbone of the Tech4Life product ecosystem

No product may be licensed, promoted, or commercialized unless it appears in this index.

---

## 2. Scope

This index applies to:
- Physical products (devices, tools, accessories)
- Software and digital systems
- Hybrid hardware–software systems
- Methodologies and operational systems
- Certified frameworks released under TOIL

Each indexed item is governed by:
- Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0
- Associated Product Pack documentation
- Applicable collaboration and royalty agreements

---

## 3. Product Identification Standard

Each product is assigned a **unique TOIL Product ID** using the following format:

**T4L-TOIL-###-SLUG**

Where:
- **T4L** = Tech4Life & Beyond
- **TOIL** = Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0
- **###** = Sequential product number (zero-padded)
- **SLUG** = Short, uppercase product slug

Example:
- **T4L-TOIL-001-CDD**

This ID must appear in:
- TOIL Registration Record
- Technical Summary
- Licensing documents
- GitHub repositories
- Internal royalty tracking systems

6. Collaboration Agreement (if multiple contributors)

## 6. Lifecycle States

Each product in the index may exist in one of the following states:

- **Concept** – Idea registered, not yet prototyped
- **Prototype** – Functional validation in progress
- **Active** – Ready for licensing or internal use
- **Licensed** – Under one or more active royalty agreements
- **Dormant** – Paused, archived, or deprecated

State changes must be recorded with date and reason.

---

## 7. Traceability & Prior Art

For each product, traceability is established through:
- Public or controlled publication date
- GitHub commit timestamps
- Internal document versioning
- TOIL Product ID consistency
- The matching record stored in `records/` under the same TOIL ID

This ensures:
- Prior art protection
- Clear ownership attribution
- Legal defensibility under license law

Each TOIL Registration Record in `records/` must match a row in this index by TOIL ID.

---

## 8. Access Control

The full TOIL Product Index is accessible to:
- Tech4Life Core Architects
- Legal and ethics reviewers
- Authorized licensing managers

Limited, non-sensitive excerpts may be made public for transparency and trust-building.

---

## 9. Governance

- This index is maintained by the Tech4Life Core Architecture Team
- Any modification requires documented justification
- Deletions are not permitted; products may only be archived

---

## 10. Legal Notice

All products listed in this index are governed by the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0. Commercial use requires a separate royalty agreement with Tech4Life & Beyond LLC.
